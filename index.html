            The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), also known as the Global Goals, were adopted by the United Nations
            in 2015 as a universal call to action to end poverty, protect the planet, and ensure that by 2030 all people
            enjoy peace and prosperity. The 17 SDGs are integrated—they recognize that action in one area will affect
            outcomes in others, and that development must balance social, economic, and environmental sustainability.
        </p>

        <p>
            SDG – Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development is universal, transformational,
            holistic and people-centered, and will leave no one behind. An intergovernmental set of 17 aspirational
            Goals with 169 targets, further elaborated through indicators focused on measurable outcomes. SDG is
            achieving sustainable development in its three dimensions – economic, social and environmental – in a
            balanced and integrated manner. Several SDG targets are to be achieved before 2030; even by 2020. NITI
            Aayog, with the Prime Minister as its chairperson, has been entrusted with the role to co-ordinate with
            States and UTs for SDGs. In Tamil Nadu, the Government have constituted a High Power Committee with the
            chairmanship of Chief Secretary to Government to oversee the implementation of SDGs. Eight thematic Working
            Groups have been formed to review and monitor the achievement of goals and targets. The implementation is
            co-ordinated by the Planning & Development Department and State Planning Commission.
